<!-- Basically, there are two types of properties such as Reactive Properties and Private 
Properties.

Reactive Properties has of three types such as Public Property, Tracked Property & 
Boolean Property.

Reactive Properties

Public Property: If you want to make the property to be called from other component, 
you need to declare this property with @api decorator in the calling component. 
Along with this, if the value changes on this property, component will be re-rendered 
automatically. That’s why, it’s reactive.

Track Property: If you want to track the property’s value, you need to declare this 
property with @track decorator. Along with this, if the value changes on this property, 
component will be re-rendered automatically. That’s why, it’s reactive. 
Track property is also called private reactive property. Because, caller component 
or component A can not call with @track decorator property to the calling component 
or component B.

Boolean Property: By default, Boolean Property has the value of false. 
If you call the component with just  Boolean Property name, the Boolean 
value would be true and component will also be re-rendered due to @api decorator. 
That’s why, it’s reactive.

Private Property
Private Property can be used only by the JS class in JS file. If the value changes 
on private property, the component doesn’t re-render. So, it’s not reactive. You 
should not put any decorator (@api, @track) for declaration of private property. -->
